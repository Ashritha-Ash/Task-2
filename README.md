# Task-2

1. Variables

A variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value, allowing you to reuse and modify that value throughout the program.

2. Data Types

Data types define the kind of data a variable can store (like numbers, text, or True/False), which helps Python decide how to process or compare the values correctly.

3. Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)

Conditions allow the program to make decisions by checking whether something is true or false and then executing different code based on that result.

4. Loops (for/while)

Loops let you repeat a block of code multiple times, either for a fixed range (for loop) or until a condition becomes false (while loop).

5. Functions

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task, helping you write cleaner, modular, and more efficient programs.

6. Input / Output

Input allows users to give data to the program, while output displays results or messages back to the user, enabling interaction.
